      <p class="research-description">At HARP Research, Inc., our Independent Research Fellowship Program
        offers a unique opportunity for driven individuals to contribute to
        high-impact scientific and technical research outside the constraints
        of traditional employment or academia. This educational program empowers
        fellows to engage in real-world research, collaborate with experienced
        advisors, and publish open-source or peer-reviewed work that advances
        the frontier of knowledge. As a fellow, you may contribute to ongoing
        initiatives or pursue an independent research topic aligned with HARP
        Research’s mission. Through structured mentorship, rigorous methodology,
        and an emphasis on academic integrity, this fellowship fosters both personal
        and professional growth. While uncompensated, the program is designed to equip
        you with tangible experience, formal recognition, and lasting contributions
        that can support future academic, entrepreneurial, or industry pathways..</p>
